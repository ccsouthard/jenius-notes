### Homework

- Go through and make all the fixes we went over today
- Ensure that everything is completely consistent across all categories
- Make sure you have validated all categories, combined or removed any that you feel are weak
- Ensure that all of the text is free of any ms word paste fragments and such, only plain text
- Split notes and portfolio into two different repos
- Look through notes after everything is organized and make sure there isn't anything that you now feel like you can fit into a category or deserves a new category
- Look through all your work and trim down anything that you don't feel fits extremely well with the message and image you are trying to get across with this website. Cutting things is hard, but you have to stay focused.
- Ensure that you have linked every piece of content on the site to a specific business goal (not just $$$$, furthering career or hobbies), and ensure that piece of content is pushing your goal in the right direction

### Why to focus and trim down your work

- You want to present your best work (according to the audience that you want to target)
- You want people to see the work that you want them to see in the limited amount of time they are on your site
- You don't want to spend time working on things that people won't see or that you are not proud of
